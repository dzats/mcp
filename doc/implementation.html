<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
mcp is a relatively simple tool to copy a bunch of files to
several destinations. Each destination shall have the mcpd daemon running. mcp
uses TCP and (multicast) UDP as underlying protocols. By default, it tries to
automatically detect the best route for the transfer and can combine multicast
UDP transfer and TCP transfer (for destinations inaccessible through UDP
multicast).
</p>
<p>
The route is chosen by the following algorithm. At first, mcp tries to establish
a multicast connection with all the multicast reachable destinations. If there are
some destinations left, mcp establishes a unicast (TCP) connection with one of
them and sends a list of the remaining destinations to it. This destination
(mcpd) then behaves much like the sending mcp. It tries to establish the
multicast connection with received destinations, then it establishes a unicast
connection with one of the remaining ones (if any). Picture 1 illustrates a
possible route for nine destinations.

<h2 id="build">Build Instructions</h2>
<p>
mcp can be built on Linux and FreeBSD. Gmake and cmake can be used.<br>
Gmake build:
<pre>
$ gmake
</pre>
Cmake build:
<pre>
$ cmake
$ make -f Makefile
</pre>
No special installation routine currently exists. However, there is a template
for FreeBSD port in the port/mcp subdirectory, which can be used to install mcp.
</p>
<p>
There are several configurational macro definitions, which can be used to tune
mcp/mcpd build. These macroses can be added to CXXFLAGS (GNUmakefile) and
ADD_DEFINITIONS (CMakeLists.txt) with -D prefix (-DNDEBUG).
<ul>
  <li>USE_MULTICAST - Enable support for the multicast file transfer. Without
  this macro only the unicast TCP transfer will be used.
  <li>USE_EQUATION_BASED_CONGESTION_CONTROL - use the equation based congestion
  control for the multicast file transfer. It is based on <a
  href="#ref_1">[1]</a>, but with modification in the loss event rate
  measuring. <i>(Not sure, if I've implemented this congestion control method
  correctly. It works good, when multicast transfer takes place in the clear
  network environtment (without TCP traffic flows). But it shows a very poor speed
  if there are many tcp connections present.)</i>
  <li>NDEBUG - disable debug messages and assert(3) checks
  <li>BUFFER_DEBUG - enable detailed debug messages for the distributor
  <li>DETAILED_MULTICAST_DEBUG - enable detailed debug for the multicast
transfer
</ul>
</p>
<h2 id="classes">Main Classes</h2>
<p>
The main classes of mcp/mcpd are illustrated in the following diagram.
</p>
<table>

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There are two main groups of classes. The first group (Readers) are 
the classes derived from <code>Reader</code>(<code>Distributor</code>).
They are <code>FileReader</code> and <code>UnicastReceiver</code>. The
second group (<code>Writers</code>) are the classes derived from
<code>Writer</code> (<code>FileWriter</code>, <code>UnicastSender</code>,
<code>MulticastSender</code>). There is exactly one <code>Reader</code>
per a running mcp/mcpd instance (fork). It receives data from disk or from a TCP
connection and transimits it to the <code>Writers</code>.
</p>
<p>
Up to three <code>Writers</code> can be run in the same time. One instance for
each of the classess is derived from <code>Writer</code>. <code>FileWriter</code>
writes the received data on disk. <code>UnicastSender</code> and
<code>MulticastSender</code> transmit the received data to the next
destination(s). There is one more main class that stands alone from the common
scheme. This is <code>MulticastReceiver</code>. It receives data sent by
<code>MulticastSender</code> and writes it to disk. For mcpd sessions with
<code>MulticastReceiver</code> no Reader is created. The whole mcpd
functionality in this case is completely implemented in the MulticastReceiver
class. This communication is illustrated in the following object diagram.

<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>
Each of the writers and the reader are implemented in separate threads. For
synchronization between these threads the <code>Distributor</code> class is
used. It controls that the data is transmitted to all the <code>Writers</code>
before the buffer space occupied by this data will be reused. It also handles
delivery and processing of the errors. <code>Distributor</code> is the base
class for <code>Reader</code>. Therefore, the <code>FileReader</code> and
<code>UnicastReceiver</code> objects are responsible for all the synchronization
and errors delivery.
</p>
<p>
Distributor has the following fields for syncronization purposes:
<ul>
  <li><code>operation:TaskHeader</code> - information about the current file or
directory
  <li><code>buffer:uint8_t*</code> - buffer with the data for writers
  <li><code>reader:Distributor::Client</code>
  <li><code>file_writer:Distributor::Client</code>
  <li><code>unicast_sender:Distributor::Client</code>
  <li><code>multicast_sender:Distributor::Client</code>
</ul>
<code>Distributor::Client</code> structure contains the following information about particular <code>Reader</code> or <code>Writer</code>.
<pre>
  // Structure describing status of the reader or a writer
  struct Client
  {
    bool is_present; // flag indicating whether the object is active
    bool is_done; // flag indicating whether the current task is done by
      // this object
    uint8_t status; // status of the last task, see connection.h
    unsigned offset; // data offet in the distributor's buffer

    Client() : is_present(false), is_done(true), status(STATUS_OK), offset(0) {}
  };
</pre>
The synchronization is implemented in the following way:
<ol>
<li>Reader opens a file or a directory
<li>Reader calls <code>Distributor::add_task()</code> method. It puts the
information about the current file to <code>operation:TaskHeader</code>, sets
is_done field for all the writers to <code>false</code> and set the buffer
offset to <code>0</code>.  <li>When reader has some data, it calls
<code>Distributor::get_space()</code> method which returns the amount of free
space available in the buffer. If no free space available the reader is blocked
until the space will be released. When <code>get_space()</code> method returns
some space the Reader puts data into the buffer and calls
<code>Distributor::update_reader_position()</code>. This method updates
<code>reader.offset</code> and wakes up all the Writers that have been waiting
for a new data.
<li>When some Writer wants to write/send data it calls
<code>Distributor::get_data()</code>. If there is some data available its
size will be returned, otherwise the Writer will be blocked until the Reader
puts some data into the buffer and calls
<code>Distributor::update_reader_position</code>.  <li>After some data has been
written, the <code>Writer</code> calls
<code>Distributor::update_writer_position()</code>. This method updates its
buffer position and wakes up the Reader (if required).
<li>When all the file data read the Reader calls
<code>Distributor::finish_task()</code>, which waits for all the Writers
to finish.
<li>If there are some files left to read, the above algorithm is repeated 
for the next file, otherwise the reader calls
<code>Distributor::finish_work()</code> and delivers all the unsent errors to the source (for <code>UnicastReceiver</code>). The <code>
Distributor::finish_work()</code> method sets <code>operation:TaskHeader</code>
to the trailing task and waits until all the writers finish their work.
</ol>
The class diagram for the distributor is illustrated in pic. 4. Protected
members of the Distributor class are used by the Readers. Almost all the public
members are either Writer's interfaces or wrappers for the Errors class's
methods.

<h2 id="unicast">Unicast Transfer</h2>
<h3 id="unicast_init">Session Initialization</h3>
<p>
A TCP connection is used for the unicast file transfer. The client (mcp or
mcpd, for the next hop transfer) establishes a TCP connection with the server
(mcpd). Only this connection is used during the session. No additional
connections are created. The client routines are implemented in the
UnicastSender class, and the server rotines are implemented in the
UnicastReceiver class.
</p>
<p> Unless the -o (preserve order) option are specified, the destinations are
sorted by ip addresses to partially adapt for the network topology.
<code>UnicastSender::choose_destination</code> routine chooses a destination
for the next hop. Currently, it is always the fisrt destination. The client
calls the <code>UnicastSender::session_init()</code> method, which establishes
a TCP connection and sends the initial data. The following sequence diagram
illustrates work of the session_init() method.
 </p>
<br><a style="border: medium none ; padding: 0pt;" href="unicast_session_init.png"><img src="unicast_session_init.png"></a>

<p>
At first the client sends SessionInitializationHeader structure containing a general information for the particular session.
</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" style="empty-cells:show;">
<caption>Session Initialization Header</caption>
<tr height="6">

<tr align="center" height="32">

</tr>
</table>
<ul>
  <li>version - protocol version (2)
  <li>flags - the following flags are currently defined.
    <ul>
      <li>PRESERVE_ORDER_FLAG(1). If set (-o option), the first destination
always will be choosed be <code>UnicastSender::choose_destination</code>.
Without the -o option UnicastSender will sort the destinations.
      <li>UNICAST_ONLY_FLAG(2). if set (-U option), neither mcp nor mcpd won't try to establish multicast connections.
      <li>VERIFY_CHECKSUMS_TWISE_FLAG(4). if set (-c option), UnicastReceiver will additionally read file from the disk and verify the checksum. Note: Checksum is always verified for the received data.
    </ul>
  <li>n_sources - the number of sources specified to the mcp tool
  <li>path_length - length of the target path for the server
  <li>path - target path for the server (specified as mcp argument)
</ul>

<p>
Then the client sends zero or more DestinationHeader structures.
These structures contain necessary information for the server to establish
the next hop unicast connection (pipelined transfer).
</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" style="empty-cells:show">
<caption>Destination Header</caption>
<tr height="6">
<td width="80"></td><td width="80"></td>

<tr align="center" height="32">

</tr>
</table>
<ul>
  <li>addr - IP address of the destination 
  <li>path_length - length of the target path for the particular destination
  <li>path - the target path for the particular destination
</ul>

<p>
When the above information for all the destinations is sent, the client sends
the DestinationTrailing structure.  It is a DestinationHeader structure with
zero addr and path_length followed by the MD5 checksum for all the previously
sent data.
</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" style="empty-cells:show">
<caption>Destination Trailing</caption>
<tr height="6">
<td width="80"></td><td width="80"></td>

</tr>
<tr align="center" height="64">
<td colspan="8">MD5 checksum</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul>
  <li>MD5 checksum - Checksum for the previously send headers
</ul>

<p>
Then, the client awaits the reply from the server.
The server sends the reply before it tries to establish the next hop connection.
If the reply has status 0(STATUS_OK) the client finishes the initialization.
</p>
<h3 id="unicast_session">Session</h3>
<p>
When all the writers are initialized, the <code>UnicastSender::session</code>
routine is called. The work of the <code>UnicastSender::session</code> routine
is illustrated in the following diagram.
</p>

<br><a style="border: medium none ; padding: 0pt;" href="unicast_session.png"><img src="unicast_session.png"></a>
</p>
All the transfers inside the <code>UnicastSender::session</code> routine are
asynchronous.  For each file or directory the client sends the
<code>FileInfoHeader</code> data structure.
</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" style="empty-cells:show">
<caption>FileInfoHeader</caption>
<tr height="6">
<td width="80"></td><td width="80"></td>
<td width="80"></td><td width="80"></td>
<td width="80"></td><td width="80"></td>
<td width="80"></td><td width="80"></td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" height="32">
<td>unused</td>
<td>type</td>
<td colspan="2">mode</td>
<td colspan="2">name_length</td>
<td colspan="2">name_offset</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" height="32">
<td colspan="8">file_size</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center" height="32">
<td colspan="8">file_name (variable length)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul>
  <li>type - 0 mean a file, 1 - a directory
  <li>mode - the unix file mode (flags and permissions)
  <li>name_length - length of the file name and the path from the specified location
  <li>name_offset - offset of the actual file name (without path)
  <li>file_size - length of the file data (in bytes)
  <li>file_name - file/directory name and the path from the specified location
</ul>
The file info header contains name, path and size for the transferred file.
File size is used to separate files in the flow.  If the source file size
increased during the transfer, only the first file_size bytes will be
transferred. It is controlled by FileReader::read_from_file.  If the file has
been shrinked during the transfer, the TCP out-of-band data will be used to
delimit the file from the next FileInfoHeader structure. (<i>this is an ugly solution, but there were some bugs in processing of TCP OOB in FreeBSD 7</i>)

<h2 id="multicast">Multicast Transfer</h2>
<p>
For the multicast file transfer multicast session is established with the
reachable destinations. The multicast session is implemented in the
MulticastSender and MulticastReceiver classes. MulticastSender stores
unconfirmed sent messsages in the MulticastSendQueue object. MulticastReceiver
maintains two queues: MulticastRecvQueue and MulticastErrorQueue.
MulticastRecvQueue contains messages received but not processed by the
MulticastReceiver, and MulticastErrorQueue contains error messages the
MulticastReceiver should send.
</p>
<a style="border: medium none ; padding: 0pt;" href="multicast_classes.png"><img src="multicast_classes.png"></a>
<p>
The client side of the multicast file transfer is implemented in the
MulticastSender class. mcp or mcpd calls
<code>MulticastSender::create_and_initialize()</code> static method which
returns a newly created MulticastSender object. Then mcp/mcpd creates a new
thread and calls <code>MulticastSender::session()</code> method which does all
the client's routine. 
</p>
<p>
The MulticastSender::create_and_initialize method does the following:
<ol>
<li>Choose the destinations available through the multicast UDP and
network interface, that will be used. Unless the -g is not set only link-local
destinations (for one of the interfaces) can be used.
<li>Create an object of the MulticastSender class.
<li>Calls the <code>MulticastSender::session_init()</code> routine.
<li>If <code>MulticastSender::session_init()</code> succeeded the object is
returned, otherwise the routine deletes the object and tries to establish
the multicast session again unless some fatal error occurred.
</ol>
The <code>MulticastSender::session_init()</code> routine tries to establish
the multicast session with the selected destinations. The Multicast session is
identified by a multicast address and an ephemeral udp port. New multicast
address is randomly choosen from the range
<code>MULTICAST_EPHEMERAL_ADDR_RANGE</code>. It will be called an ephemeral
multicast address.

The Multicast session initialization looks the following.
<code>MulticastSender::session_init</code> se
<a style="border: medium none ; padding: 0pt;"
href="multicast_session_init.png"><img src="multicast_session_init.png"></a>
<p>

After choosing an ephemeral address and a port the
<code>MulticastSender ::session_init()</code> tries to establish the session.
</p>

<h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>
<p>
Currently, both the multicast and the unicast transfers are completely unsecure.
They are designed for local network protected by firewalls.
